**Evolving Economy Simulator** ‚Äî Developer Vision & Project Roadmap

---

### üéØ Project Vision
Create a dynamic, explorable economic simulation game with realism, adaptability, and educational value. Users should be able to simulate real-world economic scenarios (e.g. 2008 housing crash, post-COVID automation boom) and test policy and individual-level interventions in real time.

---

### üîë Core Pillars
1. **Fully Interactive Simulation**
   - Every parameter (UBI, automation level, recession probability, company behavior, education cost, etc.) can be adjusted live within the simulation.
   - Scenario presets for major events like the Great Recession, Tech Bubble, etc.

2. **Rich Agent Logic**
   - Each agent has:
     - Age, health, education level
     - Hobbies, talents, and soft/hard skills
     - Preferences and personality traits
     - Risk tolerance and ambition
   - Agents choose paths dynamically based on skills and interests
   - Career decisions (e.g. going into trades vs. college) are influenced by income potential, scholarships, dropout risk, and personality

3. **Expanded Job & Industry System**
   - Add more sectors: e.g. Trades, Sales, Creative, Manufacturing, Education, Finance, Transportation
   - Companies exist within industries with:
     - Hiring capacity
     - Stock market performance
     - Automation risk
   - Job tree includes entry, mid, and advanced career levels

4. **Daily Life Cycle + Life Events**
   - Agents simulate a daily routine (school/work -> home)
   - Health decay, aging, accidents, retirement, disease, or burnout events
   - Insurance or healthcare access tied to jobs

5. **Macro Policies & Programs**
   - UBI, taxes, subsidies, public schooling, Medicare-for-all, stimulus
   - Simulation of short-term vs. long-term effects

### üß† AI-Driven Agent Behavior
- Personality affects:
  - Career ambition (entrepreneur vs. employee)
  - Work/life balance
  - Willingness to relocate, retrain, or upskill
- Hobbies/skills impact suitability across job trees

---

### üèóÔ∏è In-Game UI Control System
- Centralized overlay UI (toggleable) that shows when hovered
- Auto-hide when not hovered (with delay buffer)
- UI Elements:
  - Live economic stats
  - Adjustable simulation parameters (e.g. time speed, UBI toggle)
  - Industry filter controls
  - Event history / logs
  - Stock market dashboard
  - Agent behavior sliders (e.g. risk appetite, savings rate)

---

### üß™ Future Suggestions
- Support multiplayer simulations for group testing
- Enable "rewind" + timeline slider
- Save/load scenarios
- Assign user-created policy goals (e.g. reduce unemployment below 5%)
- Visualize inequality, economic mobility, and wealth distribution
- Integrate chat-driven command interface (LLM optional)
- Sound/music effects tied to economy (tense when in recession, light during boom)
- Generative agent quotes based on morale, politics, etc.
- Data export for analysis in CSV/Excel

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Bugs / Fixes Needed
- Inconsistent visual updates (sometimes frame skips)
- Trails misrender during fast movement
- UI toggles cause conflicting states if clicked fast
- Tooltip hover bugs when too many agents cluster
- Poor career path logic for low-education agents

---

### ‚úÖ Next Milestones
1. Build complete centralized UI overlay system
2. Refactor agent decision logic
3. Add industry/education/job trees in config file
4. Create scenario preset loader (2008, post-COVID, etc.)
5. Add dynamic career visuals and event animations

Ready for development.
